Welcome to the description of my small website. I make use of the under mentioned template for setting up the website.

This website is a part of my small projects where I make use of a basic Bootstrap template to set it up. Thank you for visiting! 
Feel free to reach to me on nimish.mailbox@gmail.com

The reason why I didn't remove the template information is because me as a developer, believe that information should be free and open to everyone. And since these templates were allowed to be used freely (under the condition that we cite the developer), the fact should be respected and the source should be cited.

Hi,

thank you for downloading. Have fun and tell your friends about us ;)

CSS
----------

The theme stylesheet is css/style.default.css. If you want to make any changes, 
you can do it here or better to override it in custom.css so you can update the original theme stylesheet if an updated is released. 
Changing to another colour variant, is just a matter of replacing css/style.default.css with css/style.pink.css in index.html.

Javascript
----------

Apart from the Bootstrap JS components, the majority of JS is located in /js/front.js.
